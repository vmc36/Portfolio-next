## Portfolio Documentation

This is a documentation guide for your portfolio built with Next.js and hosted on Vercel.
Here you will find information about the project structure, how to run it locally, and how to deploy it on Vercel.

To run your portfolio locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
2. Clone your portfolio repository: `git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>`
4. Install project dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`
6. Open your browser and access `http://localhost:3000` to view your portfolio locally.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Deployment on Vercel

Vercel is a hosting platform that allows easy deployment of Next.js applications. Follow these steps to deploy your portfolio on Vercel:

1. Go to the Vercel website: [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Create an account or log in.
3. In the Vercel dashboard, click on "Import Project".

After the deployment is completed, Vercel will provide a URL where your portfolio is hosted. You can access that URL to view and share your portfolio online.
